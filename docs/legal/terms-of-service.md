We do not guarantee that Obscreen will meet your requirements or that its operation will be uninterrupted or error-free.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall either Party be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, resulting from this Agreement, even if a Party has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Each Party’s total liability to the other Party for all damages shall not exceed the amount you paid for Obscreen in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 8 shall limit a Party’s liability for its breach of the other Party’s intellectual property rights.

## 9. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless us, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, arising out of or in any way connected with your use of Obscreen, your violation of these Terms, or your breach of any applicable laws.

We shall defend, or at our option settle, any claim brought against you by a third party to the extent it alleges that Obscreen as delivered to you and used as authorized in this Agreement infringes or misappropriates any U.S. patent, copyright or trade secret of any third party (“Infringement Claim”), and pay any damages awarded in a final judgment, or amounts agreed in a monetary settlement, in any such claim defended by us; provided that you provide us: (a) prompt written notice of the Infringement Claim; (b) sole control over the defense and settlement of the Infringement Claim; and (c) all information and assistance reasonably requested by Obscreen Team in connection with the defense or settlement of, any such Infringement Claim. If any Infringement Claim is brought or, in our judgment, may be threatened, we may, at our sole option and expense: (i) procure for you the right to continue to use Obscreen; (ii) modify Obscreen to make it non-infringing; (iii) replace the infringing portion of Obscreen with non-infringing technology that is functionally equivalent to the infringing portion of Obscreen; or (iv) if none of the foregoing is commercially practicable, terminate this Agreement upon written notice to you, and refund a pro rata portion of unused and pre-paid Fees for the outstanding balance of the then current Term.
