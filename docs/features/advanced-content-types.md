# Advanced content types

Obscreen supports the following advanced content types:

## External Storage

Let imagine you have a 1000 pictures folder on your USB stick under a specific directory.
You can setup an external storage content type targeting that directory and let Obscreen play content from this folder
when USB flashdrive is inserted in the player.

## Composition

A complete content disposition system which can be used to create complex content scenarios.
You can use almost any content type as a composition item.

## Playlist Embed

Basically a symbolic link to an existing playlist which can be used to control scheduling at a playlist level.
