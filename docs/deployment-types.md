# Deployment Types


There are two main deployment types: **Standalone** and **Distributed**.

## Standalone deployments 

They are the most common and easiest to set up. They are ideal for a simple, single-screen installation. Nevertheless, it's possible to manage multiple screens from a single server using ~~tricky~~, ~~dirty~~, ~~legacy~~ advanced features and configurations. See [Standalone](./deployment-types/standalone.md) for more information or directly choose your preferred deployment type.

- [Repeated Single Standalone](./deployment-types/standalone.md#repeated-single-standalone-setup)
- [Managed Multiple Standalone](./deployment-types/standalone.md#managed-multiple-standalone-setup)

## Distributed deployments

They are more complex and require a central server to manage the players. They are ideal for larger installations with multiple screens. See [Distributed](./deployment-types/distributed.md) for more information or directly choose your preferred deployment type.
